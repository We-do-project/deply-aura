                    <span>Refurbishment for Reuse
                    </span><br>Once collected, your electronic devices are given a second life through our professional refurbishment process. We restore computers, monitors, and peripherals to near-new condition, ready for resale to non-profits and communities. This helps reduce e-waste, extend the lifespan of valuable electronics, and provide affordable technology to those who need it most.<br>
                    <span>Eco-Friendly Disposal
                    </span><br>For items that can't be refurbished, we ensure that all components are responsibly recycled following the highest environmental standards. This process helps prevent harmful materials from ending up in landfills, preserving the ecosystem for future generations.
